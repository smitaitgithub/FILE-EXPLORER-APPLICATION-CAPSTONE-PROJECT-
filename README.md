🗂 File Explorer – Capstone Project
📘 Project Overview
This project is a simple File Explorer Application built using C++ (C++17) .It enables users to explore, list, and manage files and directiories through a command line interface. The project showcases the uses of the C++ filesystem library for performing dynamic file and directory operations .It serves as an excellent learning example learning example for understanding how real-world file management systems function.

🎯 Objective
To design and implement a console-based File Explorer that allows: • Navigating through directory structures. • Displaying detailed file and folder information. • Performing file operations like creating, renaming, and deleting files/folders. • Showcasing practical implementation of the library in C++.

⚙️ Technologies Used
• C++17 • STL (Standard Template Library) • Library for file and directory handling • Command-Line Interface (CLI)

🚀 How to Run
Open Git Bash or Command Prompt inside your project folder.
Compile the code using: g++ file_explorer.cpp -o file_explorer -lstdc++fs
